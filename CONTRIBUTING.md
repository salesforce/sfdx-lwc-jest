## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.

## Review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge. Also make sure to reference the related issues in the pull request message if any.

## Release

Each `winter*`, `spring*` and `summer*` branch/dist tag is the version of this package used for the corresponding Salesforce release. The `latest` dist tag corresponds to the latest Salesforce release, rather than the most recent code changes from the `master` branch. New code changes from `master` are published to the `prerelease` tag.
